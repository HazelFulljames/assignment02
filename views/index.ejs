TODO:
URGENT:
Village verification

NOT QUITE SO URGENT:
Make the map size dependent on screen size,
Make the input fields look nicer,
Graphs (give the BBB pearlers/verified users access to the database for their town?),
Unique town maps

WOULD BE NICE TO HAVE:
Password resetting,
Pearl deletion,
Rework pearl database to be by-town and by-date so it's easier to sort through,
Village "lock down" system so I can ransom it,
Message board for verified users,
Show town names (Request by ptown2),
Make name of color show up on hover (Request by ptown2)
</pre>
